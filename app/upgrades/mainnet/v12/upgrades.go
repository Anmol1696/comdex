// An error occurred during the creation of the CMST/STJUNO pair, as it was mistakenly created in the Harbor app (ID-2) instead of the cSwap app (ID-1).
// As a result, the transaction fee was charged to the creator of the pair, who is entitled to a refund.
// The provided code is designed to initiate the refund process.
